## Notes every day
March 10 2022
- Intro took 2 tomatoes since I also  read official documentation. Remember ! after a function is a macro call
- Had fun installing extensions and trying out VIM in VSCode. I want to create a task that would  rustc agaisnt  the  active file 
  then run the executable file
- More notes per exercise folder

March 11 2022
- Variables 1 tomatoe
- Notable notes LOL. "Variable bindings are immutable by default, but this can be overridden using the mut modifier."  see [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/variable_bindings/mut.html). 
- Interesting how Rust forces devs to use mut to make a variable mutable
- Got a bit derailed cause I also read about the guessing game [chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)

March 14, 2022
- Did a sidequest about the [guessing game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
  Got a glimpse of cargo,loops, conversion, data types and exception handling. cool stuff
